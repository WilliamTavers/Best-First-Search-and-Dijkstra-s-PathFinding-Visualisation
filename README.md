# Best-First-Search-and-Dijkstra-s-PathFinder-Visualiser



This project is a Python-based pathfinding visualizer built using the Pygame library. It implements Dijkstra's algorithm and Best-First Search to find the shortest path between two points in a grid. Users can interactively place start and end points, as well as obstacles, to see how these algorithms navigate complex paths.

Features:

Interactive grid for setting start, end, and wall cells.
Visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Best-First Search.
Real-time pathfinding animation.
Customizable grid size and colors.


Instructions: 
1. Left-click on two cells in the grid to highlight the start (blue) and end (red) cells
2. Left-click again to add walls (black)
3. Right-click to remove cells 
4. Press 'd' to start Dijkstra's Algorithm 
5. Press 'b' for Best-First Search 
6. Press 'c' to clear the grid and start over
